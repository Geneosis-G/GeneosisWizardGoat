[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]Probably the funniest mod I made so far, controlling this little magic ball is really awesome when you are used to it :) The idea of this mod came from a suggestion of Heavenly Cross on the Telekinetic Goat page to add a way to move the obects freely around you... After thinking a bit about it I imagined that the best way to do it was to control a dot in space and attach objects to it. Also the wizard hat inspired me and I wanted to make a mod that really gives you magic powers :p
So I started with those two main objectives and quickly found some other fun magic powers I could add in this mod. The first I developped was the fire magic, the first version was working fine and making NPC burn correclt, but I thought that it was not really interesting to be only able to burn people so I decided to add a better fire propagation system that can be transmitted to any object and the final version is really cool ^^
Then the Wind and Magnet magic are mostly taken from existing mutators so nothing too hard here.
Now come the Mind Magic: a way to grab items from a distance. Finding a way to attach objects to the magic sphere was a bit harder than I thought and I ended up using the tongue code and the "grabber" included in it.
In the end I added the life and death magics mainly to help with the Zombie Goat mod XD Also some people asked me for a way to kill permanently people, so here it is ;) You can eventually resurrect them after that if you changed your mind. Life magic also add an AI on the NPC if he didn't have one.
